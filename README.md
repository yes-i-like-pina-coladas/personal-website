# Personal Website

This is the source code for my personal website, built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.

## Features

*   **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   **Vite**: A fast build tool that provides a quicker and leaner development experience for modern web projects.
*   **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
*   **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
*   **Framer Motion**: For animations.
*   **MDX**: For blog posts.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/personal-website.git
cd personal-website

This will start the development server at `http://localhost:5173`.
