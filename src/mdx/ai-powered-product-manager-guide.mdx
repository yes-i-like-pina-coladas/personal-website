If you're a Product Manager feeling overwhelmed by the AI revolution, you're not alone. With new tools and use cases emerging every week, it can be hard to know where to begin or how to keep up.

I wrote this blog post as an attempt to bring some structure to AI adoption for PMs who feel lost in the noise. Whether you're just getting started or want to integrate AI more systematically into your work, this guide is here to help you take that next step.

## The Three Types of AI Product Managers

Before diving into the *how*, let's clarify what people usually mean by "AI-powered Product Manager." There are three distinct paths:

![AI PM types diagram](/assets/blog/ai-powered-product-manager-guide/ai-pm-types.png)

**AI Platform Product Manager**: You're building the infrastructure, such as APIs, data pipelines, and ML ops tooling. Your world focuses on technical scalability and developer experience.

**AI Product Manager**: You're delivering AI-powered features directly to users, such as recommendation engines, chatbots, and smart automation. Your priority is AI UX and model performance.

**AI-Powered Product Manager**: This is anyone who uses AI to increase the speed or quality of the outcomes of their PM work. For example, using AI tools for making PRDs faster, gaining deeper insights, and streamlining workflows. You're not building AI products, but you're applying AI to improve your effectiveness as a PM.

This guide focuses entirely on that third path, because that's where most of us need to start.

## Why This Matters More Than You Think

As [Ethan Mollick](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emollick/), a prominent researcher in AI, puts it: "If AI development completely stopped, we would still have 5-10 years of rapid change absorbing the capabilities of current models." The window to get comfortable with these tools is now.

Here's a statistic: [**71%**](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelwells/2024/11/05/71-of-employers-prefer-ai-skills-above-experience-in-2024/) **of employers now prefer employees with AI skills over those with just experience**. This is something that is happening already, not a future trend!

But this isn't just about career survival. Research shows that AI offers **better productivity and higher-quality work**. [McKinsey research](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/how-generative-ai-could-accelerate-software-product-time-to-market) shows AI can accelerate software product time-to-market significantly, while a [Procter&Gamble study](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/how-generative-ai-could-accelerate-software-product-time-to-market) demonstrates that the quality of the work of an individual and AI working together significantly exceeds the quality of a team without AI. And these studies were done on older models, while AI is still developing exponentially!

## The SCALE Framework: Your Roadmap to AI-Powered PM

Through my journey of integrating AI into product management work, I've found a five-step approach that makes this transformation more manageable. Think of it as SCALE:

![SCALE framework overview](/assets/blog/ai-powered-product-manager-guide/scale-overview.png)

* **S** – Start Small & Smart

* **C** – Contextualise Your Domain

* **A** – Assemble The Right Tools

* **L** – Link AI Across Workflows

* **E** – Establish a Learning Loop

Let's break down each step.

## Step 1: Start Small & Smart (S)

The temptation is to tackle your biggest, most complex challenge first or to start using everything everywhere all at once. Resist it!

Rather than trying to overhaul your entire workflow with AI from the start, focus on identifying where AI is naturally effective. Getting this first step and a quick win is a sustainable way of doing it. 

AI works best when handling large volumes of data, generating first drafts, or performing repetitive tasks that follow clear patterns. You need to be more cautious when applying AI in areas that require emotional sensitivity, ethical judgment, or high-stakes decision-making. Understanding these strengths and limitations early helps you apply AI effectively and avoid common pitfalls.

**AI excels at:**

* Data and content-heavy tasks

* Repetitive processes

* Pattern-based analysis

* First drafts and ideation (the blank canvas problem)

* Working with publicly available information

**Be extra cautious with AI for:**

* Emotionally intelligent decisions

* Ethical judgment calls

* Strategic direction setting

* High-stakes decisions

* Sensitive data processing

Here’s what Product managers think would be the best areas to start integrating AI into, according to [ProductPlan’s “The 2025 State of Product Management Report”.](https://www.productplan.com/2025-state-of-product-management-report/)

![Where to start integrating AI per ProductPlan report](/assets/blog/ai-powered-product-manager-guide/where-to-start.png)



### Adopt the "How can I do this with AI?" Mindset

This is something I picked up from Aparna Chennapraga, the CPO at Microsoft, whose [appearance on Lenny's Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbbfXAWcuUo) stuck with me. She mentioned that she created a Chrome extension that displays the question "How can I do this with AI?" every time a new tab opens, which I believe perfectly captures this mindset: constantly on the lookout for practical, high-leverage AI use cases. I highly recommend giving it a try. This simple prompt helps rewire your thinking toward AI-first problem-solving and uncovers use cases you might not have considered otherwise. 

That said, it's important to be mindful not to overuse AI for tasks that don’t truly require it. In some cases, using AI can slow things down, especially when the task is simple or the overhead of prompting and refining output outweighs the benefits. Use AI where it clearly adds value, not just for the sake of using it. However, this is something that you can only truly understand with practice and by trying to apply AI solutions in different areas of your workflows.

### Look for AI Features in Familiar Apps

**Pro Tip:** One of the easiest and most effective ways to integrate AI into your work is to explore how it's already embedded in the tools you use every day. This way, you're not reinventing your workflow, but enhancing it with minimal friction.

![AI features in familiar apps](/assets/blog/ai-powered-product-manager-guide/ai-features.png)

Here are some examples of popular PM tools with handy AI features:

* [**Figma Make**](https://www.figma.com/make/) – Quickly turn wireframes or ideas into interactive prototypes directly in your design workflow.

* [**Miro AI**](https://miro.com/ai/) – Summarise brainstorming sessions and extract key points automatically.

* [**VWO AI Copilot**](https://vwo.com/copilot/) – Quickly ‘vibecode’ simple A/B tests when your dev team is overloaded.

These native integrations are much more likely to stick and deliver real value, especially when you're just getting started. Begin by looking for the AI features in your toolset; they’re often hiding in plain sight and can be a great source of quick wins.

## Step 2: Contextualise Your Domain (C)

The biggest mistake people make is jumping into the AI tools without context and then abandoning them because they do not bring the expected results. AI models are only as good as the information you provide them. In the world of LLMs, the context is king.

The widely discussed 'prompt engineer' role, once predicted to become second nature across many professions, is gradually evolving into a new kind of role: the 'context engineer.'

For PMs, mastering context engineering will be essential to effectively leverage AI and get meaningful, consistent results. In a way, this has always been part of the role, writing PRDs and acting as a central source of knowledge for the team, but the rise of AI changes the nature of that responsibility. It now becomes essential to know how to gather the right context and where to apply it for optimal AI outcomes.

### Context Levels

Not all AI interactions are created equal. In most AI chatbots, there are two primary levels of context you can use: **chat-level** and **project-level**. Chat-level context is temporary; it only lasts as long as the conversation. Once the session ends, the model can forget the important details, requiring you to repeat background details in future chats.

**Project-level context**, on the other hand, allows you to maintain persistent information across tasks. Tools like Claude Projects or Custom GPTs make it possible to preload relevant documents, templates, and context, so you're not starting from scratch each time.

![Context library example](/assets/blog/ai-powered-product-manager-guide/context-library.png)

Creating custom GPTs or project spaces is one of the most powerful ways to use AI effectively today. For example, you can create a custom GPT equipped with your documentation templates, ticket-writing guidelines, and company cheat sheet. Using this setup for documentation or Jira tickets will yield far more relevant and consistent results than starting a blank chat every time, because the system reuses your tailored context on every request.

Investing just a bit of time upfront in creating a structured context environment can dramatically boost the quality and efficiency of your AI interactions.

### Create a Context Library

If your company doesn’t already use RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines or AI connected to internal documentation and systems, a good first step is to create a simple "Company Context Cheat Sheet". This document can later be used to feed relevant context into AI tools to significantly enhance the quality of outputs. Here's what can be included:

* **Department Purpose & Scope**

* **Business Unit/Team-specific information**

* **Organizational Context**

* **Key Stakeholders**

* **Technical Systems**

* **Common Projects**

* **Standard Terminology**

* **Key Metrics**

**Avoid including**: user data, private company information, or anything non-public. What you include should adhere to your company’s policies and align with the workplace culture. That said, creating context responsibly is one of the most important skills for getting meaningful results with AI.

As a next step, consider enriching your context library by gathering frequently used assets such as documentation and ticket templates, your product roadmap, a stakeholder map, or a component library for prototyping or coding-related tasks. These will not only support consistency in your outputs but also allow for more effective use of AI tools when applied to these use cases, which we'll cover in more detail later.

### Prompting Library and Techniques

If you often find yourself repeating complex or nuanced prompts, consider building a prompt library. This can be a simple Notion page, Google Doc, or dedicated tool where you save high-quality prompts for reuse. A good prompt library allows you to standardise your approach, save time, and increase consistency, especially when collaborating with others or working across multiple tools.

Here are some advanced prompting techniques to consider using in the prompt library:

* Few-shot prompting (Give a few examples of input/output to serve as guidelines)

* Self-reflection (Ask the model to reflect on the output it provided first to enhance quality)

* Role-based prompts (e.g., "Act as an award-winning UX researcher")

It's important to understand that prompting is a practical skill you get better at by doing. While having a well-organised prompt library for context can be incredibly helpful, there's no substitute for hands-on experimentation and learning from which prompts actually perform better for you in real-world use. 

What is worth noting as well is that, given the speed of the development of the AI models, some prompt techniques that used to work well become obsolete (e.g. chain-of-thought prompting does not work well with most advanced models anymore). 

To conclude, although prompting in general is still a valuable skill, overly investing in creating thorough prompt libraries and completing courses might not yield the expected return on investment long-term.

### The Context Feedback Loop

While initial investments in building your context library are helpful, they don't mark the end of the process. Context engineering is ongoing: a continuous cycle of feedback and revision that evolves alongside your needs. Monitor your outputs for recurring issues, then return to your context library with targeted improvements. 

For example, if the chatbot consistently inserts placeholders instead of your team's specific technology names, update the context to make outputs more precise and reduce manual editing.

## Step 3: Assemble The Right Tools (A)

Once you get your first quick wins and organise the way you gather context, the next step is to work on your toolbox to make sure you have all the right tools for different tasks. 

While general-purpose models like ChatGPT or Gemini are incredibly versatile, building a diverse AI toolkit tailored to your specific use cases can significantly improve your outcomes. It is important to understand that even though a lot of AI tools seem to be identical, they often do have different strengths and limitations. The more you experiment with tools optimised for different tasks, such as data analysis, UX prototyping, research, or automation, the more effectively you'll be able to plug AI into your product workflows.

### Creativity vs. Precision

One of the key trade-offs in AI tools is creativity versus precision. The creativity and AI hallucinations actually stem from the same underlying mechanisms. More creative outputs often come with a higher risk of hallucination, while highly factual responses tend to be less imaginative. As a result, no single model excels at both. Tools like NotebookLM are designed to minimise hallucination and work best for grounded, context-heavy tasks like summarisation or research. On the flip side, general-purpose models like ChatGPT shine in creative tasks like brainstorming or concept generation, though they can require more oversight when accuracy is critical.

![Creativity vs precision spectrum](/assets/blog/ai-powered-product-manager-guide/creativity-vs-precision.png)

[NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/), [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/), [Claude](https://claude.ai/), [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/)

Understanding this trade-off helps you make smarter tool choices. Building a toolkit that spans this spectrum allows you to pick the right model for the right task.

### Search and Deep Research

While searching the internet with AI is quickly becoming standard practice, deep research remains an underused capability, partly because the most effective tools are still often behind paywalls. Unlike quick searches, deep research is better suited for complex, layered questions and strategic work. It can be incredibly valuable for PMs, whether you're in need of a deep dive into a new technical topic or conducting a rapid market landscape analysis.

A more advanced and less commonly used approach to deep research is connecting AI tools to rich documentation systems or large sets of internal files, creating a simple RAG system. For example, you can connect an AI agent to a GitHub repository to analyse codebases or link it to a Google Drive or Dropbox folder to extract insights from scattered documentation and reports across multiple folders.

This is where deep research tools really stand out. General AI search tools are great for quick answers, but deep, context-aware systems unlock serious strategic value. Having both in your toolset is essential: quick lookups get you unstuck fast, while specialised tools help you go deep when it matters most.

### Rapid Prototyping and Vibe Coding

As someone once said, the hottest programming language in the world right now is English.

AI-powered rapid prototyping and vibe coding give Product Managers access to capabilities that once required deep technical skills, now achievable through the use of plain English. You can now build prototypes faster and at much higher fidelity, which significantly enhances collaboration with design and engineering teams.

In fact, I believe high-fidelity prototypes will soon become the new standard for PRDs, or at the very least, a critical complement to them. They allow for a much clearer transmission of product vision and can accelerate everything from early user testing to stakeholder alignment for complex projects.

AI prototyping tools make it easier and faster to mock up UIs, test complex feature ideas, or prepare for UX research sessions. These are just some examples of tasks where AI can reduce friction and speed up early-stage product work.

There’s a spectrum of tools for this, ranging from low-barrier, no-code platforms that require little setup to more flexible tools that benefit from some technical knowledge. To work effectively across a variety of product tasks, it’s worth building a toolkit that includes both ends of that spectrum. Here are some of the examples of the tools with their positioning on the spectrum:

### Tools Landscape Diagram

[V0](https://v0.app/), [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/invite/52aafd57-ec2e-4d9a-a126-ff72a8640fbe), [Replit](https://replit.com/), [Windsurf](https://windsurf.com/), [Cursor](https://cursor.com/)

**Pro Tip 1:** Clear context is still one of the most powerful levers in AI prototyping and vibe coding. Even when working with AI, taking the time to create a detailed PRD upfront can dramatically improve the quality and consistency of the outcome. For extra clarity and coherence, you can also share annotated screenshots or build a simple component library. These cues help AI tools produce more reliable and aligned results.

**Pro Tip 2:** If you're feeling a bit extra, use AI tools to build and ship a personal side project. Not only is this a great way to reignite your passion for product management, but it also creates a powerful learning loop. I recently built [cognitivebiaslab.com](http://cognitivebiaslab.com/) using Cursor.ai, and in just three months of working on it, I learned more about web development and practical AI usage than I had in a few previous years working in the industry. Treat it as a learning amplifier. 

### Other Tools to Explore

Beyond the core categories, there's a long tail of AI tools that are more specific to your role, workflow, and interests. For example, you might use [**n8n**](https://n8n.io/) as a no-code automation platform supercharged with AI for building custom process flows. Or try [**NotebookLM**](https://notebooklm.google/) for deep, structured research and knowledge management that goes beyond what general-purpose chat tools can do. If you are tired of creating PowerPoints, try [**Gamma**](https://gamma.app/) or **[Napkin AI.](https://www.napkin.ai/)**

This part of the journey is highly personal and domain-specific. As you get more comfortable, you’ll start to discover niche tools that give you leverage in your specific domain and for your specific tasks.

Ultimately, the goal is to build a diverse and personalised AI stack through hands-on experimentation. Try things, keep what clicks, and discard what doesn’t. Your ideal toolkit should reflect how you work best.

Here's how my AI toolkit looks at this moment:

![Tools landscape collage](/assets/blog/ai-powered-product-manager-guide/tools-landscape.png)

[NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/), [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/), [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/), [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/invite/52aafd57-ec2e-4d9a-a126-ff72a8640fbe), [Cursor](https://cursor.com/), [n8n](https://n8n.io/), [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app)

## Step 4: Link AI Across Workflows (L)

One of the most effective yet underused strategies is creating pipelines of AI tools that work together, rather than using them in isolation. By connecting multiple tools, such as using one for data collection, another for analysis, and a third for presentation, you can streamline entire workflows and squeeze out the last drops of efficiency. These connected systems allow outputs from one tool to become the inputs for another, amplifying the overall impact and enabling PMs to scale their efforts without scaling their workload.

### Example 1: Research Workflow

1. Use [**ChatGPT**](https://chatgpt.com/) or [**Gemini**](https://gemini.google.com/app) to conduct deep research on a topic and gather high-quality sources and materials.

2. Feed those outputs and references into [**NotebookLM**](https://notebooklm.google/) (a contextual research assistant).

3. [**NotebookLM**](https://notebooklm.google/) processes the information and generates a concise 15-minute podcast-style summary. It also lets you query the material for highly specific, grounded answers.

This workflow cuts down research time and delivers more focused, digestible insights, saving hours of manual work.

### Example 2: Sentiment Analysis Workflow

1. Collect user reviews from various sources using n8n or manually

2. Use [**ChatGPT**](https://chatgpt.com/) to summarise the reviews and extract the key insights, either within [**n8n**](https://n8n.io/) or externally.

3. Feed the key insights into a Custom [**ChatGPT**](https://chatgpt.com/) that generates ready-to-use JIRA tickets.

This workflow speeds up and partially automates the integration of the user feedback.

### Example 3: Vibe coding

1. Start by creating a clear, detailed PRD for your feature idea with a chatbot.

2. Feed this PRD into a tool like [**Lovable**](https://lovable.dev/invite/52aafd57-ec2e-4d9a-a126-ff72a8640fbe) or [**V0**](https://v0.app/) to generate an initial prototype. This helps you quickly explore feasibility and user flow.

3. Take the generated code and move it into a tool like [**Cursor**](https://cursor.com/) or [**Claude Code**](https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code) to refine and enhance the prototype into a higher-fidelity, production-ready version.

This layered workflow helps you move from concept to production faster, with minimal technical overhead.

## Step 5: Establish a Learning Loop (E)

This last step is about building a learning system that evolves alongside AI's rapid development. It's not easy. Staying current requires consistent learning and iteration, but it's *essential*. As AI capabilities change fast, having a habit of adapting your workflows and tools is what separates those who thrive from those who fall behind. It's about an ongoing habit of learning, experimenting, and refining your workflows.

### Staying Current Without Burnout

Here are a few tips on how to stay up to date with AI without losing your focus or getting burned out:

* Try using one new AI tool or feature each week/month. Explore how it fits into your workflows and what it’s best at. Don’t try every tool at once, this will only lead to overwhelm and frustration.

* If you are able to afford it, consider upgrading to paid tiers of the tools you use often. It’s usually a small investment with a high return, unlocking better features, speed, and reliability without annoying limits.

* Don’t forget to have fun with it! Maintaining a playful, experimenter mindset is one of the most effective ways to stay sharp and keep learning without burning out. Start a side project, show AI to your kids, or just do something fun and unrelated to your career and job. This playful approach generates ideas and keeps you motivated.

### Cut Through the Noise

Research and then follow 3 to 5 creators who consistently share clear, practical insights. This helps you stay informed without getting overwhelmed by noise.

Here are a few I follow:

* [Ethan Mollick](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emollick/?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAAAGUakBGLMO02LmS5BwXexrsKODQQpx2qI) – Professor at Wharton, known for translating cutting-edge AI research into everyday applications. He does a lot of research on AI and is one of the industry thought-leaders.

* [Andrej Karpathy](https://www.youtube.com/@AndrejKarpathy/videos) – Computer scientist and educator sharing hands-on technical breakdowns. I recommend his [lecture on how LLMs](https://youtu.be/7xTGNNLPyMI?si=z3oz7kCLMlCbpK7m) work if you want to get a bit more technical.

* [Claire Vo](https://open.spotify.com/show/4aRP2XSavdtrLG5FZoonOK) – Host of the “[How I AI?](https://open.spotify.com/show/4aRP2XSavdtrLG5FZoonOK)” podcast, focused on real-world AI use cases in product and business. Claire interviews different people from leading product companies and asks them to share their AI use cases. The podcast is always super practical and fun to listen to.

## Final Thoughts

Becoming an AI-powered PM isn’t about replacing your skills but about sharpening and scaling them. You don’t need to master every tool or trend, but you do need to build habits of experimentation, learn where AI fits best in your workflows, and stay grounded in the problems you’re solving.

I came up with the SCALE framework based on my own experience of learning to use AI in product management, to help others put some structure around it. It's meant to be a practical and flexible starting point for anyone looking to bring AI into their product practice. Whether you're just testing the waters or already building with AI, I hope this guide has given you a few helpful ideas to work with.
